# Genome-simulator
This is a web application using some models of GTR(general time reversible model) family to simulate genome.

## Description
In this web application, 7 models (GTR, K80, HYK, TN93, JC69, F81, F84) from GTR family are included that can be used to simulate Genome. The application provide default values of parametera for each model.   
Besids choosing by hand, users can also upload the model type and their parameters by uploading a file. The format of the file is fixed. Users could find more details of the format in exmple_input.txt.

## Usage
The website of the web application is [easyGTR](https://xinning.shinyapps.io/easyGTR/)  
The original page of easyGTR should be like this:

If you want to upload the parameters from a file, choose "upload" in model type firstly. Click "browse" to upload the input file (check the format!) Then click "run".  
If you want to choose parameters by hand, firstly choose a model and change its parameters. Click "run" to et results.

## Results
The results parts are seperated into 6 tabs.
The result of aligned sequences could be downloaded from *Simulation* tab.
